    "## `Application: Cycling speed prediction for Rotterdam` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dutch urban context, cycling is an important mode of transportation, serving both personal and commercial purposes, including delivery services. However, one of the challenges that individuals and companies frequently encounter is the lack of relevant cycling itineraries proposed by routing algorithms. This is partly due to the lack of accurate cycling speed information per road link. Hence, accurate information on cycling speeds could improve itinerary recommendation by routing apps, and, in turn, help individuals and companies to choose better cycling routes. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to obtain accurate cypling speed data is by installing speed sensors on all road links. However, this is a costly and time-consuming process. Alternatively, one could use machine learning models to estimate cycling speeds based on other variables, such as road infrastructure, traffic, and weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing a business opportunity, a data-analytics start-up company has collected data on average cycling speeds on several roads within a specific neighborhood. Now it needs to develop a machine learning model that can predict cycling speeds on any road link in the city of Rotterdam. You have been hired by this company for this task. Specifically, in this assignment you need todevelop an MLP that is capable of predicting the (average) cycling speeds per road link for the entire city of Amsterdam based publicly available street infrastructure data.\n",
    "\n",
    "List of tasks:\n",
    "1. Explore the cycling speed data provided by the company, to determine if it can be used for your task\n",
    "1. Train an MLP model to predict average cycling speed\n",
    "1. Evaluate and reflect on the performance of your model\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have access to 2 data sets:\n",
    "1. Training dataset: first_campaign.gpkg\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Tasks and grading**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is divided into 4 subtasks: (1) data inspection, (2) regression model, (3) MLP model, (4) performing an out-of-sample validation.\n",

    "    1. Split the data between training and test set.\n",
    "    1. Start with a simple model:\n",
    "        - Use a linear regression model\n",
    "        - Make that the columns are in the same order in both train and test sets.\n",
    "        - Evaluate the performance on the test set, using the R2, is the performance decent to use this model?\n",
    "    1. Plot the predicted speed on the test set against the true speed. Is there a speed region where the prediction are better/poorer?\n",
    "    1. Print the coefficient of the regression. Which features contribute to faster speed? Does that make sense?\n",
    "1. **Training a more advanced MLP model** [2.5 pnt]\n",
    "    1. Scaling variable: Which variables would you scale and why? (provide a list), use a minmax scaler.\n",
    "    1. Hyperparameter tuning: Design a grid search over the following hyperparameter space:\n",
    "        - hidden_layer_sizes: [(18),(10,10,10,10,10),(18,10)]\n",
    "        - learning_rate_init: [1e-2,1e-3,1e-5]\n",

    "1. **Out-of-sample validation** [3 pnt]\n",

    "    1. Load and preprocess the validation data.\n",
    "        - Make sure that the validation data have the same columns as the original data in the same order\n",
