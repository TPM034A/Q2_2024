    "### `Use of AI tools`\n",
    "AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Co-pilot, are great tools to assist with programming. Moreover, in your later careers you will work in a world where such tools are widely available. As such, we **encourage** you to use AI tools **effectively** (both in the lab sessions and assignments). However, be careful not to overestimate the capacity of AI tools! AI tools cannot replace you: you still have to conceptualise the problem, dissect it and structure it, to conduct proper analysis and modelling. We recommend being especially **reticent** with using AI tools for the more conceptual and reflective oriented questions. "
