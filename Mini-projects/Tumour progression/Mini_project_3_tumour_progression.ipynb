        "\n",
        "The progression of a tumour is a key factor for efficient diagnosis and treatment in cancer research. Patients with tumour are expected to visit hospitals multiple times for their treatment so that the size of their tumour is measured during each visit. The resulting data have enormous potential to be used to develop an analytical model for predicting the progression of the tumour. A desirable outcome is when the size of the tumour has decreased or has remained unchanged. On the contrary, when the size of the tumour has increased, additional treatments may be necessary. This analytical model can be used as a powerful tool to design medical intervention, which can lead to the reduced medicine dosage and consequently improved quality of life for the cancer patients.\n",
