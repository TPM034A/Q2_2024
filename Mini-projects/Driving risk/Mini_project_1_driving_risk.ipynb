        "\n",
        "Driving risk on roads can be measured via different indicators. Traffic crashes have been used as the most common indicators of risk on roads. However, crashes are rare events and should occur so that their data can be collected and analysed. Theodore, relying on crashes is reactive. There is a need for proactive indicators of risk such as near-misses which are one stage prior to the crashes. Near-misses can be defined based on different driving kinematics such as headway (the gap between a vehicle and its leading vehicle, in terms of time seconds). Meanwhile, many factors contribute to risk arising from distinct sources such as drivers’ demographics, past behaviours, driving style, as well as road environment and traffic characteristics.\n",
